The structure is modular and layered, similar to MVVM, where:

core/ and models/ ‚Üí define data models

repositories/ ‚Üí handle API calls and data persistence

providers/ ‚Üí act as ViewModels (business logic + state management)

screens/ and widgets/ ‚Üí represent the View (UI layer)

services/, themes/, utils/ ‚Üí reusable helpers, theming, and bootstrap setup
